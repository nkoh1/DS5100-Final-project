# DS5100-Final-project

This is a recreation of the Monte Carlo project that involves the simulation of rolling dice, flipping coins, and analyzing text. The following methods and classes were used in the creating of this project:

Classes and Descriptions:

# Die
The die class creates a Die object (or coin) to use for the duration of the program. It will have a default of each side of a coin weighting the same (both sides resulting in a 50/50 split), or each side of a die weighting the same (1/6 per face).
# Game
A game consists of rolling of one or more similar dice (Die objects) one or more times. Similar dice are represented as objects with the same number of sides (in this case, a regular 6-sided die) but sides can be weighted if chosen to be.

# Analyzer
Based on the results found within the Game class, the Analyzer class provides statistical details regarding the results through visualizations.
